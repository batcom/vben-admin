# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Context layout

This is a **multi-context monorepo** with two main domains:

| Context | Path | Technology |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | `frontend/` | Vue Vben Admin (Ant Design Vue, vxe-table) |
| Backend | `backend/` | NestJS + Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL |

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists — it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`** — system-wide architectural decisions.
- **`frontend/docs/adr/`** and **`backend/docs/adr/`** — context-specific decisions if they exist.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront.

## File structure

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md          (points to per-context CONTEXT.md files)
├── docs/adr/               (system-wide decisions)
├── frontend/
│   ├── CONTEXT.md
│   └── docs/adr/
├── backend/
│   ├── CONTEXT.md
│   └── docs/adr/
└── src/                    (not used — split across frontend/ and backend/)
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept, use the term as defined in the relevant `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding.
